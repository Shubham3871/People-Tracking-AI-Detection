🎯 People Tracking & AI Detection with YOLO11 🚀
Welcome to the People Tracking & AI Detection project! 👥 This repository showcases real-time object tracking using the powerful YOLO11 model, allowing you to detect and track multiple people in video footage with extended, smooth tracking lines. 🌐

📋 Project Overview
In recent years, tracking people's movement in real time has become possible thanks to advancements in AI 🤖 and neural networks 🧠. This project leverages the YOLO11 architecture to efficiently track objects across frames, annotate them with extended yellow tracking lines, and save the output video for further analysis. 🎥✨

💡 Features
Real-Time Object Tracking ⏩: Track people across video frames with precise bounding boxes and IDs.
Extended Tracking Lines 🟡: Visualize movement patterns clearly using smooth yellow tracking lines.
Enhanced Video Output 🎬: The output video is saved with full annotations, ready for analysis.
Scalable AI Solution 🔄: Customizable for various applications like sports analytics ⚽, surveillance 🕵️‍♂️, and more.
